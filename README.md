# Loan Approval Prediction

This project aims to predict car loan approvals using machine learning techniques. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and underwent thorough exploration through visualization to uncover insights. After preprocessing and feature engineering, the final model utilized was an XGBoost classifier, which achieved an impressive accuracy of 96.8%.

## Overview

1. **Data Collection**: The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, featuring various attributes related to car loan applicants.
  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualization techniques were employed to explore the dataset, revealing patterns and relationships among features.

3. **Model Development**: An XGBoost classifier was trained and optimized through hyperparameter tuning. This was performed using both GridSearchCV and Optuna, with Optuna demonstrating superior performance, leading to a more optimized model.

4. **Results**: The final model achieved a remarkable accuracy of 96.8%, showcasing its effectiveness in predicting loan approvals.

This project highlights the significance of data exploration and model optimization in developing predictive systems.
